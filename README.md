NLP Project for Disaster Tweet Classification

Background
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify tweets related to disasters. Given the challenges in distinguishing genuine disaster tweets from non-disaster content, automated monitoring of Twitter can enhance real-time disaster response.
Challenge
The model must accurately classify tweets, understanding the nuanced language that may use disaster-related keywords metaphorically.

Objectives
•	Develop a Classification Model: Predict if a tweet is disaster-related.
•	Ensure Accuracy and Precision: Minimize false alarms.
•	Enhance Robustness: Handle language variations and slang.
•	Achieve Scalability: Process large volumes of tweets in real-time.

Key Tasks
1.	Data Exploration and Preparation: Load, clean, and tokenize a dataset of 10,000 tweets.
2.	Feature Engineering and Model Selection: Extract features and train various classification models.
3.	Model Evaluation and Validation: Assess model performance using accuracy and recall metrics.
4.	Deployment: Create a web application for users to input tweets and receive predictions.
5.	
Conclusion
This project leverages NLP techniques to improve disaster response by automating the classification of disaster-related tweets.
